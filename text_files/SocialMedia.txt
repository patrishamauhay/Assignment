The Impact of Social Media: Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. While it has many benefits, such as staying connected with friends and family, it can also have negative effects on our mental health. The constant comparison to others and pressure to present a curated image can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Additionally, social media can be a major source of distraction, making it harder to focus on important tasks. It is important to be mindful of our social media usage and to take breaks when needed.
