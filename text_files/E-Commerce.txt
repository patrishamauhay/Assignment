The rise of e-commerce: With the growth of the internet and the increasing availability of mobile devices, e-commerce has become a major force in the global economy. Online shopping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more consumers choosing to purchase goods and services from the comfort of their own homes. This has led to the rise of major e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, as well as countless smaller online retailers. While e-commerce has brought many benefits, such as convenience and lower prices, it has also raised concerns about issues such as data privacy and the impact on local brick-and-mortar retailers.
