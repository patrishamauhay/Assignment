The history of pizza: Pizza is a beloved food that originated in Naples, Italy in the 18th century. At first, pizza was considered a food for the poor and was sold on the streets. However, as it gained popularity, pizzerias began to open up and it became a staple of Italian cuisine. In the 20th century, Italian immigrants brought pizza to the United States and it quickly became a popular food there as well. Today, pizza is enjoyed all over the world in many different variations, from classic Margherita to deep-dish Chicago-style pizza.
