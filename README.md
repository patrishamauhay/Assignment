This program is a Search Engine tool that allows you to search for a term across a set of text files.
When the program is run, a GUI titled "Koogle" will display. This will ask the user to enter their search query and to enter the search path to where they want to search. 

When the search button is clicked, the file(s) where the query appears will be displayed in the output.
There is also a "Clear" button that clears the output when clicked.

*Some features that it includes are:
  - The tool will check the contents of a set of text files and will show the ones that contain the search term.
  - The files that have the “strongest match” against the search term are returned at the top of the list. 
  - The user is able to search for multiple words (separated by commas)
  - 



If i had more time to do the assignment I would include a feature that shows suggestions to the user of what to search for. The program will get these suggestions from a collection of most common past searches from the user.
