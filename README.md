This program is a Search Engine tool that allows you to search for a term across a set of text files.

Some features that it includes are:
- searching terms with multiple terms...only shows suggested files with given searched term and not separate terms



If i had more time to do the assignment I would include a feature that shows suggestions to the user of what to search for. 
The program will get these suggestions from a collection of most common past searches from the user.
